## _Mini php framework_

### Code inspiration from laravel

My goal is to learn how to Laravel framework works under the hood by doing this project. I will read Laravel and Symfony code and implement many of those codes to this framework. I am too noob to build a framework by myself but let's hope for the best. :)

This app doesn't have any template engine. So I will might try it only for API development after I complete the framework.
